# Memory Optimization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the memory optimizations implemented for `corp_pdf` based on the analysis in `memory-improvements.md`.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Freeze @raw to Guarantee Memory Sharing ✅

**Implementation:**
- Freeze `@raw` after initial load in `Document#initialize`
- Freeze `@raw` on reassignment in `flatten!`, `clear!`, and `write`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/corp_pdf/document.rb`

**Benefits:**
- Guarantees memory sharing between `Document#@raw` and `ObjectResolver#@bytes`
- Prevents accidental modification of the PDF buffer
- Ruby can optimize memory usage for frozen strings

**Code Changes:**
```ruby
# Before
@raw = File.binread(path_or_io)

# After
@raw = File.binread(path_or_io).freeze
```

---

### 2. Clear Object Stream Cache After Operations ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `clear_cache` method to `ObjectResolver`
- Call `clear_cache` before creating new resolver instances in `flatten!`, `clear!`, and `write`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/corp_pdf/object_resolver.rb` - Added `clear_cache` method
- `lib/corp_pdf/document.rb` - Call `clear_cache` before creating new resolvers

**Benefits:**
- Prevents memory retention from object stream cache
- Frees decompressed stream data after operations complete
- Reduces memory footprint for documents with many object streams

**Code Changes:**
```ruby
# In ObjectResolver
def clear_cache
  @objstm_cache.clear
end

# In Document
def flatten!
  flattened_content = flatten.freeze
  @raw = flattened_content
  @resolver.clear_cache  # Clear cache before new resolver
  @resolver = CorpPdf::ObjectResolver.new(flattened_content)
  # ...
end
```

---

### 3. Optimize IncrementalWriter to Avoid dup ✅

**Implementation:**
- Replace `@orig.dup` and in-place modification with string concatenation
- Avoids creating an unnecessary duplicate of the original PDF

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/corp_pdf/incremental_writer.rb`

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates duplication of original PDF during incremental updates
- Reduces memory usage during `write` operations
- More efficient string operations

**Code Changes:**
```ruby
# Before
original_with_newline = @orig.dup
original_with_newline << "\n" unless @orig.end_with?("\n")

# After
newline_if_needed = @orig.end_with?("\n") ? "".b : "\n".b
original_with_newline = @orig + newline_if_needed
```

## Benchmark Results

### Key Improvements

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **write** | 1.25 MB | 0.89 MB | **-29%** ✅ |
| **flatten!** | 0.19 MB | 0.13 MB | **-32%** ✅ |
| **clear** | 0.44 MB | 0.33 MB | **-25%** ✅ |
| **Peak (flatten)** | 0.39 MB | 0.03 MB | **-92%** ✅✅ |

### Overall Impact

- **Total memory savings**: ~0.52 MB per typical workflow (write + flatten!)
- **Peak memory reduction**: 92% reduction during flatten operation
- **Cache management**: Proper cleanup after operations prevents memory retention
- **Memory sharing**: Guaranteed via frozen strings

See `memory-benchmark-results.md` for detailed before/after comparison.

## Testing

All existing tests pass:
- ✅ 61 examples, 0 failures
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API

### Running Memory Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all memory benchmarks
BENCHMARK=true bundle exec rspec spec/memory_benchmark_spec.rb

# Run specific benchmark
BENCHMARK=true bundle exec rspec spec/memory_benchmark_spec.rb:12
```

## Future Optimization Opportunities

Based on `memory-improvements.md`, additional optimizations could include:

1. **Streaming writes for `flatten` and `clear`** (Issue #3)
   - Stream objects directly to PDFWriter instead of collecting in array
   - High impact for PDFs with many objects (1000+)

2. **Reuse resolver in `flatten!`** (Issue #4)
   - Avoid creating new resolver when possible
   - Medium impact for write-heavy workflows

3. **Lazy field enumeration** (Issue #8)
   - Return enumerable instead of array
   - Medium impact for large PDFs

---

## Files Changed

1. `lib/corp_pdf/document.rb`
   - Freeze `@raw` after loading and on reassignment
   - Call `clear_cache` before creating new resolvers

2. `lib/corp_pdf/object_resolver.rb`
   - Add `clear_cache` method

3. `lib/corp_pdf/incremental_writer.rb`
   - Optimize to avoid `dup` by using string concatenation

4. `spec/memory_benchmark_helper.rb` (new)
   - Memory benchmarking utilities

5. `spec/memory_benchmark_spec.rb` (new)
   - Memory benchmark tests

6. `issues/memory-benchmark-results.md` (new)
   - Before/after benchmark results

7. `issues/memory-optimization-summary.md` (this file)
   - Summary of optimizations

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are backward compatible**
- No changes to public API
- No breaking changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Internal optimizations only

---

## Notes

- Freezing strings has minimal overhead but provides memory sharing guarantees
- Cache clearing happens automatically after operations - no manual intervention needed
- Peak memory reduction (92%) is the most impressive improvement
- Some operations show slight variance in measurements (normal for memory profiling)
